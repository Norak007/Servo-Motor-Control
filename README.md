# Servo-Motor-Control
This project demonstrates how to control four servo motors using an Arduino UNO. The motors perform a synchronized sweeping motion for 2 seconds, and then stop at a fixed position of 90 degrees.

# How It Works
All four servo motors are connected to digital pins 3, 5, 6, and 9.

Each motor performs a back-and-forth motion from 0° to 180° and back.

After running this motion for 2 seconds, all motors are set to hold at 90°.
